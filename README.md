Utilized the unofficial api from pcpartpicker to web scrape data for pc parts.
Created a simple graphical user interface with intellj IDEA IDE's built in GUI functionality.

Currently the web scraping feature is no longer working due to the new update of pcpartpicker.
However, the web links still works.

This Project is only for personal interest not for commercial use and will never be.
